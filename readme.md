## Hi there :). Things to know about this repo:
  * It is a project done in my spare time mainly to not lose my touch and maybe find new and interesting problems/challenges to go through.
  * It may not follow the best coding practices. I tend to be very verbose in my code sometimes.
  * The Typescript and EsLint settings may not be the best. (you've been warned) :)
  * This is/will be a docker-ized application running on an old laptop that I have around.
  * Maybe, at some point, I will be able to create some pipelines for a more streamlined "deployment" process
  * It is not for sale or anything. Just a project for me and my friends made with love and frustration.
## !Disclaimer: If you wil try using this project, it will not work for you because it has to be linked to a Mongo Atlas database. See the .env.example.

**Things I am trying to do/learn**:
  * Organize my work better
    - as you can see from the initial commit history, it is kind of messy
    - i want to organize things a bit better with branches for each feature/issue i am working on
  * Get more used to Typescript as I find using JS a pain in some instances
  * Learn Docker a bit better and see its advantages
  * Learn things about pipelines and how they can be setup and used properly
  * Learn shell scripting because I have 0 experience with it atm (20.05.2021)
  * Learn more about unit testing in general and/or integration testing
    - i may not be able to cover every line of code but i will do my best
  * See what I can come up with in terms of features
  * Have my own hosting machine available to the web
  * Have ssh only access to the host machine
  * Maybe some bits about security on the web
  * Have fun and learn new things I guess?

**What I am using/will use** (*this list will be updated as I go along*):
  * Technologies:
    - Nodejs
    - Typescript
    - Docker
    - Mongoose
    - Mongo Atlas for database
    - Shell script
    - EsLint
    - Jest
    - Git
  * Paradigms:
    - dependency injection (at least I try to)
    - REST stuff for endpoints
    - separation of concerns
